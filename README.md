# 370_PA1
COMP 370 - Programming Assignment 1 (DFA Simulation)

This file converts a file input into a simulated Deterministic Finite Automaton, then simulates the DFA on input strings. (See testfiles for formatting) The result outputs to a test file: "Accept" if the DFA accepts the string and "Reject" otherwise.
